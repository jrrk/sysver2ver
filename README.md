Converting System Verilog to plain Verilog using .xml dump from Verilator

This software takes a dump .xml file generated by Verilator using the --xml-only option
and parses it using the xml-light library to reproduce the original syntax (using an optimised
and simplified representation) that will hopefully (in the sense of we hope it will be useful)
be more portable between different tools, and in particular support out-of-context synthesis.

Converting System Verilog to plain Verilog using .xml dump from Verilator

This software takes a dump .xml file generated by Verilator using the --xml-only option
and parses it using the xml-light library to reproduce the original syntax (using an optimised
and simplified representation) that will hopefully (in the sense of we hope it will be useful)
be more portable between different tools, and in particular support out-of-context synthesis.

INSTALLATION

This package requires Verilator to be installed (at least git version towards 4.010), or else the
patched version here (https://github.com/jrrk/verilator.git).

opam must be installed and updated, and the following version was tested:

    opam switch 4.04.0
    eval `opam config env`
    eval `opam config env`
    opam install xml-light
    make vxml

For now the package only runs in the toplevel REPL.

Edit .ocamlinit appropriately, then

    ./vxml
